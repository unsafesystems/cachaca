Cachaça (Portuguese pronunciation: [kaˈʃasɐ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pronunciation/english/cachaca)) is a 
distilled spirit made from fermented sugarcane juice. Also known as pinga, caninha, and other names, it is the most 
popular spirit among distilled alcoholic beverages in Brazil. Outside Brazil, cachaça is used almost exclusively as an 
ingredient in tropical drinks, with the caipirinha being the most famous cocktail. In Brazil, caipirinha is often paired
with the dish feijoada. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacha%C3%A7a)).
